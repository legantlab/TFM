%% Green's Function Generation Script (Depreciated)

Description:    This file takes data from COMSOL and generates a Green's 
matrix (i.e. the "G" in G*f=u, where f is a vector of forces and u is a 
vector of displacements). Within the COMSOL script, a study is done for each 
application of a single force of magnitude 1 applied in either the x, y, or 
z direction on the surface of each mesh element. The displacement in each 
cardinal direction at points chosen in COMSOL (either random or specified)
is then saved in a .csv file

The output of this script is the variable X, a grid built by the location
of the data samples from COMSOL, and V, a cell of grid values for the grid
locations.

%% Skip First Lines
%the column headers contain the component of the displacement reported and
%   the point the displacement is measured
headers = {};

%first lines give info on data table - will skip through most of it

%now we get to the actual meat of the data; again the columns are grouped
